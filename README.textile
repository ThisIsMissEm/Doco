h1. Doco

Is a simple piece of rack middleware[1] which allows me to write stuff in textile, give it structure with mustache, and deploy it easily. It was designed for documentation, hence the name.

h2. Usage

# Install the gem: 
<pre><code>gem install doco</code></pre>
# Create your file structure, here's an example:
<pre><code>dir/
	|-- config.ru
	|-- layouts
	|   `-- default.mustache
	`-- pages
    	`-- index.textile
</code></pre>
# Add Doco to your @config.ru@:
<pre><code>require 'doco'
use Rack::Doco
</code></pre>
# Serve it up using your favourite rack server!

h2. Middleware Options

Doco's middleware can have a few options passed to it, these are:
<pre><code>:url  => '/'      # path at which to mount Doco
:root => Dir.pwd  # path in which to locate the `layouts` and `pages` directories.
</code></pre>

h2. Patches & Feedback

Patches are welcome, as is feedback, feel free to send either as a "message on github":http://github.com/inbox/new/miksago

fn1. -Maybe it's a rack application, not middleware? I'm still learning this stuff!- Hopefully it's actually middleware now.
