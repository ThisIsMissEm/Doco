h1. Doco

Is a simple piece of rack middleware[1] which allows me to write stuff in textile, give it structure with mustache, and deploy it easily. It was designed for documentation, hence the name.

h2. Usage

It's pretty simple to use, just clone this repository, and edit your layout in the layouts directory, write your content in the pages directory, and put anything else you want available in the public directory.

h2. Patches & Feedback

Patches are welcome, as is feedback, feel free to send either as a "message on github":http://github.com/inbox/new/miksago

fn1. -Maybe it's a rack application, not middleware? I'm still learning this stuff!- Hopefully it's actually middleware now.
